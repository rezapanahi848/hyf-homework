Here's a recipe for "Koofteh" (Persian meatballs) in English:

Ingredients:
- 1 lb ground beef or lamb
- 1/2 cup cooked rice
- 1 onion, grated
- 1 egg
- 1/4 cup chopped parsley
- 1/4 cup chopped mint
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 cups beef or chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Instructions:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef or lamb, cooked rice, grated onion, egg, chopped parsley, chopped mint, turmeric, cinnamon, cumin, salt, and pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly incorporated.
2. With damp hands, shape the meat mixture into medium-sized meatballs.
3. In a separate pot, bring the beef or chicken broth to a simmer over medium heat.
4. Carefully drop the meatballs into the simmering broth. Cover the pot and let the meatballs cook for about 30 minutes, turning them occasionally to ensure even cooking.
5. In a small bowl, mix together the tomato paste with a few tablespoons of water to create a smooth sauce.
6. Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the diluted tomato paste to the skillet and cook for a few minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.
7. Carefully transfer the cooked meatballs from the broth to the skillet with the tomato sauce. Gently toss the meatballs in the sauce to coat them evenly.
8. Let the meatballs simmer in the sauce for another 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
9. Serve the Koofteh hot with rice or bread.
